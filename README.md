A front end developed in React (one module) and Angular (another module).
A .NET backend using microservices connected to a SQL Server database.
Custom-built APIs (REST, SOAP, XML) for communication between front-end and back-end services, exposed via Swagger.
A file processing module with FTP support to read and generate files in different formats (flat files, PDFs, Excel).
